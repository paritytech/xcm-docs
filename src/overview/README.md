# Overview

XCM allows for different consensus systems to communicate with each other.
This allows things like:
- Sending tokens from one chain to another
- Locking assets on one chain in order to gain some benefit on a smart contract on another chain
- Calling extrinsics on another chain

But that's just the beginning.
The true power of XCM comes from its composability.
Once you can communicate with other consensus systems, you can get creative and implement whatever use case you need.
This is especially true in the context of an ecosystem of highly specialized chains, like Polkadot.

In this chapter, we will cover what XCM is, what it isn't, why it matters, and delve into the different components that make up the XCM ecosystem.

Let's begin.

# Testing

Before deploying your XCM-powered solution to production, it's paramount to test it thoroughly.
There are different levels for testing, which should be tackled sequentially:
- Message: Making sure your message works properly, according to the XCVM spec.
- Configuration: Making sure your executor's configuration is as expected.
- End-to-end: Making sure the whole flow works, in an environment as similar to production as possible.

We'll discuss tools and best practices for each of these levels.
